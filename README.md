### Difference between the result of Potential force-field and Bidirectional A-star algorithm
* Path - Astar always produces optimal path, however Potential force-field does not gaurantee optimal path and can suffer from local minima issues.
* Computational Complexity - The bidirectional Astar algorithm has a higher computational complexity than the potential field algorithm.
